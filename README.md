## What It Is

**ArduExams with Atmel® Arduino Microcontroller Board**

ArduExams contains fun questions to help you learn the Arduino. It will contribute greatly to both a hobby and a school lesson. For university students, it will provide great convenience in both midterm and final exams.

## How To Use

Firstly, try to solve multiple choice questions: [QUESTIONS-QUIZ](https://github.com/Dentrax/ArduExams/blob/master/QUESTIONS-QUIZ.md)

Secondly, try to solve the classic questions yourself: [QUESTIONS-CLASSIC](https://github.com/Dentrax/ArduExams/blob/master/QUESTIONS-CLASSIC.md)

 **WARNING:** `Before looking at the answers, please try to solve it yourself first. It's more important than anything. It's a key to success.`

**Note : The answers to multiple choice questions was [here](https://github.com/Dentrax/ArduExams/blob/master/answers/questions-quiz.md)**

**Note : The answers to classic questions was [here](https://github.com/Dentrax/ArduExams/blob/master/answers/)**

## About

ArduExams was created to serve three purposes:

**ArduExams is a basically Arduino programming learning repository coded in Arduino/C language using Arduino IDE**

1. To act as a guide to learn basic Arduino/C programming with enhanced and rich content

2. To provide a simplest and easiest way to learn detailed and interesting things about Arduino

3. There is a source for you to develop yourself in Arduino and inreace your Arduino programming level
